# Exercise 002

In this set of exercises we're going to explore the creation of your own objects.

You'll see a number of tests in [Exercise002Tests.cs](../Exercises.Tests/Exercise002Tests.cs)

These tests are currently commented out.

ðŸ‘‰ **_Uncomment all of the tests in `Exercise002Tests.cs`._**

You'll be required to create C# objects (classes) to represent a "Person".

A Person has 4 properties/data associated with them:

-   Their first name
-   Their last name
-   Their city
-   Their age

You'll need to look at the methods and tests and update accordingly.

ðŸ¤” Think about where is a good place to store this `Person` class! Remember the principles of good code organisation.

## Once you're done

Time to move onto [the instructions for Exercise003](./Exercise003.md).
